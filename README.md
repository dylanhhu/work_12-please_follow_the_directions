Dylan Hu - Work 12: Please follow the Dir[ections]

## Compilation and Execution
Use `make` to compile.

Run `make run` or `./main.out` to execute.

Takes one command line argument, which is the path to list.

## Notes
Total directory file sizing is not reliable, and breaks sometimes, for whatever reason. I think it's because the `off_t` type is not specifically defined, and depends on compiler, platform, etc.
